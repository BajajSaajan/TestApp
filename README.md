For Note: 
I had a doubt in second locaton requirement so i have created a two ways to see the user location one is popover and anothe one is map page. if you want to use popover window then simply call this method on item click "showPopover($event, item)" then it will show popover window right now i am redirecting user to map sceen to show the location of the user when hover it.
